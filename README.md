# React-weather-api
This is a basic weather application built as part of my React learning process.  
The project focuses on understanding API integration, state management, and component-based UI development in React.

## About the Project
The application fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays current weather information for a searched city.

This project was built to practice:
- Fetching data from external APIs
- Handling asynchronous operations
- Managing state in React
- Rendering dynamic data in the UI

## Features
- Search weather by city name
- Displays temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed
- Uses real-time data from OpenWeather API
- Simple and responsive UI

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- OpenWeather API

## How It Works
The user enters a city name.  
The app sends a request to the OpenWeather API and updates the UI with the received weather data using React state and hooks.
